# Media Downloader

It's exactly what it sounds like. It downloads media. 

Tested working on:
 - Youtube (long form and shorts)
 - Youtube Music (songs and full playlists)
 - Facebook (long form and shorts)
 - Instagram (long form, and reels)

Does NOT work on ANY DRM content such as Netflix or Spotify. This is not possible and will not be added.

When you find a video you want to download:
 - Copy the URL from the browser, or from the share button,
 - Paste it into the program when it asks,
 - Watch/archive it. Simple.

Videos can be downloaded as video with audio, video without audio, and audio without video. 

## Requirements
Python 3.x  
yt-dlp  

You can install yt-dlp using pip:

```pip install yt-dlp --break-system-packages```  
(or preferably start a virtual environment and just pip install...)
